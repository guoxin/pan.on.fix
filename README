This package of codes generates Table 4 of the draft "Towards a Mathematical Foundation of Immunology and Amino Acid Chains" available at arXiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.6031v2

The C dynamic library should be compiled in unix-like system (e.g. MacOS, Linux) since POSIX thread tool is used. To compile, just type

$ make

and the Makefile script will finish all the things.

The main programme is "fdpa.R",

$ Rscript fdpa.R

which outputs "fdpa.report.Rdata" where one finds all the results. To parse it, use "parseFixedPan.R". The code package is available on github: https://github.com/guoxin/pan.on.fix.git
